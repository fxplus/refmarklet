#refMarklet

This bookmarklet is only of use on a drupal node edit page with some custom theming. It allows the fast adding of some custom tags to the (Markdown formatted) body text in order to create an easy to use referencing guide.

The javascript from this bookmarklet has now also been added directly to the referencing filter [drupal module](https://github.com/tombola/ask_ref_filter).

See [blog post for details](http://tombola.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/Markdown-syntax/).
